# root-finder
A MATLAB implementation of root finding algorithms(Secant Method, False Position Method)
## Secant Method
In numerical analysis, the secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f. The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method.
## False Position Method
An algorithm for finding roots which retains that prior estimate for which the function value has opposite sign from the function value at the current best estimate of the root. In this way, the method of false position keeps the root bracketed.
